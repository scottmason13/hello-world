   <h1>Scott Mason, c. 1989</h1> 

   <p>Born and raised in Minnesota, the land of <a href ="https://www.exploreminnesota.com/list/5-ways-to-enjoy-minnesotas-10000-lakes"> 10,000 lakes</a>. It was only when I left that I realized Minnesota was second to none. <strong>Especially Wisconsin.</strong></p>

   <p>I now live in Chicago and have lived here for the last 9 years, my work history can be found on <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-mason-b48ba420/"> LinkedIn.</a></p>
